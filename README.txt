#tidal_rivers

This is my repo for analyzing gage data for our senior design project, 'TITLE HERE'. 

Here you'll find all the data, notebooks, and figures related to both water quality and instantaneous data from tide gages.
- notebooks: obviously this is where my JupyterNotebooks are saved. Each gage has its own notebook.
- ST#_WQ: directories of this form are for a station with water quality (WQ) data. This includes our excel sheet, netcdf file, panel with all good time series, and individual plots for interesting metrics.
- ST#_IN: same as above, but for an instantaneous station
